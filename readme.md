## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to work with background positioning and the calc function to properly position the cirles at the edges of the screen. This is the best that i could manage so far. Hopefully as my CSS improves I'll be able to figure out how to recreate that particular layout.
